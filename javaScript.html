		3. Create a random number between 1 and 10. Store this in rand.
		4. Set usersGuess to -1. (Thinik about why -1)

			6b. prompt the user to input a new guess
			6c. if usersGuess is too low, alert this fact.
			6d. if usersGuess is too high, alert this.
		7. After the while, alert that they are correct and how many guesses it too.
